|2500   | 7          | 6    | 5          |
|2500   | 8          | 6    | 5          |
|3000   | 9          | 9    | 6          |

Hopefully you can see above that when a tie of two or more records appears, both RANK and DENSE_RANK assign the same rank to all records with the same value. However, where they differ is that RANK continues the rank count in line with the ROW_NUMBER series, while DENSE_RANK does not, and instead continues the rank count with the next value after the duplicate rank.

Now getting to your question, whether you choose RANK or DENSE_RANK depends on your requirements. For example, if you were reporting winners, and always needed to report a first, second, and third place, regardless of ties for each place, you would use DENSE_RANK. Otherwise, you would use RANK, which might mean that there is no second or third place. If you were certain that there could never be duplicates, then you could just use ROW_NUMBER.
